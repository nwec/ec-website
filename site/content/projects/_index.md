        Comprehensive HIV Prevention Projects


        The Evaluation Center oversees the evaluation efforts and serves as a
        capacity-building entity for 20 HIV prevention demonstration projects
        funded by the Chicago Department of Public Health at 15 sites throughout
        the city. In addition to providing support for site-specific evaluation,
        the Evaluation Center is conducting an overarching evaluation of all
        demonstration sites, which includes a network analysis of linkages
        between sites, simulation modeling of program milestone attainment,
        qualitative analysis of implementation challenges and successes,
        quarterly capacity-building webinars, and analysis of surveillance data
        to assess impact on HIV incidence over time.

        Project PrIDE


        To build upon the success of the Center for the Evaluation of HIV
        Prevention Programs in Chicago (Evaluation Center), the EDIT Program‘s
        Evaluation Center Extension was funded to to evaluate PrEP demonstration
        projects, as well as Data to Care demonstration projects using
        surveillance data sources to identify persons not in HIV care,
        specifically targeting men who have sex with men (MSM)and transgender
        persons. In addition to providing technical assistance and capacity
        building for site-specific evaluation, the Evaluation Center Extension
        is conducting an overarching evaluation of all demonstration sites,
        including the development and execution of rigorous evaluation plans
        that focus on process, implementation, and outcome evaluations,
        including organizational network analyses.

        EDIT CARES


        Traditionally, most of EDIT’s work with community agencies is funded
        through entities like the Chicago Department of Public Health, primarily
        centered on HIV prevention and care. We recognized that this limits the
        types of organizations and programs that we are able to provide services
        to, thereby restricting our impact on the community. The result of our
        reflection is EDIT CARES (Community Award for Research and Evaluation
        Services). Starting in Spring 2018, EDIT will release an annual request
        for proposals (RFP) to community organizations in Chicago to fund EDIT
        staff time to provide pro-bono evaluation, data integration, and other
        technical assistance services.

        Be Heard


        Often transgender and gender-nonconforming persons change their voice in
        order to better represent their gender identity. However, many do so
        without any vocal training and thus risk harming their voice. As a
        result, Be Heard was developed to address this health concern through
        educating young transgender and gender non-conforming persons on how to
        alter their voice without causing damage. This program empowers
        transgender and gender-nonconforming youth by not enforcing strict
        standards on what it means to sound feminine, but rather provides
        healthy techniques for youth to use if they choose to modify their voice
        as a form of gender expression.

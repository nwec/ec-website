    heading: Comprehensive HIV Prevention Projects
    text: >-

      The Evaluation Center oversees the evaluation efforts and serves as a
      capacity-building entity for 20 HIV prevention demonstration projects
      funded by the Chicago Department of Public Health at 15 sites throughout
      the city. In addition to providing support for site-specific evaluation,
      the Evaluation Center is conducting an overarching evaluation of all
      demonstration sites, which includes a network analysis of linkages
      between sites, simulation modeling of program milestone attainment,
      qualitative analysis of implementation challenges and successes,
      quarterly capacity-building webinars, and analysis of surveillance data
      to assess impact on HIV incidence over time.

    heading: Project PrIDE
    text: >-
      To build upon the success of the Center for the Evaluation of HIV
      Prevention Programs in Chicago (Evaluation Center), the EDIT Program‘s
      Evaluation Center Extension was funded to to evaluate PrEP demonstration
      projects, as well as Data to Care demonstration projects using
      surveillance data sources to identify persons not in HIV care,
      specifically targeting men who have sex with men (MSM)and transgender
      persons. In addition to providing technical assistance and capacity
      building for site-specific evaluation, the Evaluation Center Extension
      is conducting an overarching evaluation of all demonstration sites,
      including the development and execution of rigorous evaluation plans
      that focus on process, implementation, and outcome evaluations,
      including organizational network analyses.

    heading: EDIT CARES
    text: >-
      Traditionally, most of EDIT’s work with community agencies is funded
      through entities like the Chicago Department of Public Health, primarily
      centered on HIV prevention and care. We recognized that this limits the
      types of organizations and programs that we are able to provide services
      to, thereby restricting our impact on the community. The result of our
      reflection is EDIT CARES (Community Award for Research and Evaluation
      Services). Starting in Spring 2018, EDIT will release an annual request
      for proposals (RFP) to community organizations in Chicago to fund EDIT
      staff time to provide pro-bono evaluation, data integration, and other
      technical assistance services.

    heading: Be Heard
    text:
      Often transgender and gender-nonconforming persons change their voice in
      order to better represent their gender identity. However, many do so
      without any vocal training and thus risk harming their voice. As a
      result, Be Heard was developed to address this health concern through
      educating young transgender and gender non-conforming persons on how to
      alter their voice without causing damage. This program empowers
      transgender and gender-nonconforming youth by not enforcing strict
      standards on what it means to sound feminine, but rather provides
      healthy techniques for youth to use if they choose to modify their voice
      as a form of gender expression.
